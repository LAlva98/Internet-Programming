             <p>The above image is a quote and a picture of the creater of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup. </p>
                <p>The origin of C++ programming  started in 1979 when Bjarne Stroustrup was working in his Ph.D. He started working on C with classes for example, he began at another language which would have object-orientated worldview blended with the highlights of C programming language. In 1983, it was named C++ and it incorporated classes, inheritance, in-lining, default function arguments, polymorphism, encapsulation and strong type checking.he first business version of C++ programming was published in October 1985. </p>
                <p>C++ got a major upgrade in 2011 with the release of C++ that would make the language more fluid.</p>
                <p><strong>Fun Fact: C++ was first called C with classes until it was changed in 1983. </strong></p>
