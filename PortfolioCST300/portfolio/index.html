            <p>Thank you for vising my professional portfolio website</p>
            <p> I am currently a CS major at CSUMB.</p>
            <p>My goal is to ultimately help people with CS.</p>
            <p>I think CS has more impact in our daily lives than people </p>
            <p>realize and that's what I want to do create a positive impact.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy trying new places to eat!</p>
